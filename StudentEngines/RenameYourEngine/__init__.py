        Part 1 - 4
    
        The system calls this function once at the beginning of the game.
        The student engine uses this function to initialize its data
        structures to the initial game state.

        Parameters
            logger: a reference to the logger object. The player model uses
                logger.write(msg) and logger.error(msg) to log diagnostic
                information.
                
            config: a Python 'dict' structure that has mapped all the
                parameter names to their values, as specified in the
                config.cfg file.
        
            studentModel: reference to a StudentEngineModel object. See
                the documentation for that class in the file
                Model/interface.py. This engine calls the methods in

        The system calls this function after a player makes a valid move in
        the game. The student engine updates its data structure with the
        information about the move.
